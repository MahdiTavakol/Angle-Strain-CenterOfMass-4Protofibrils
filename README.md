# Angle-Strain-CenterOfMass-4Protofibrils
There are a couple of python codes to calculate the angle distribution, center of mass and protofibril strains from a simulation trajectory under the "dump" folder. There is also a file called "Driver" to automate the processing for several simulations. Modify the variable "Sims"  in "Driver.sh" and "AngleLengthDistAllSims3.py" files to the name of your simulation directories. The names in the python code must be "," separated, while in the bash they mush be space separated.
